# Code Cracker Game
This is a tiny javascript game made as a pastime.
The rules are simple and they are as follows -

* You have to make a guess of what the hidden code might be.
* Each guess must consist of 4 numberic characters.
* Numbers may be used more than once!
* You win only if your guess is an exact match.
* You lose if you fail to guess the code under 10 guesses.
* 'Y' Indicates a number is in the correct position.
* 'E' Indicates a number is part of the code, but not in the right position.
* 'E' Doesn't consider how many times a number exists in the code.
* 'X' Indicates a number is not part of the code.
